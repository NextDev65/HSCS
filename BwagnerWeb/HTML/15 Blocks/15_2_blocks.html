No man is an island,<br>
Entire of itself;<br>
Every man is a piece of the continent,<br>
A part of the main.<br>

If a clod be washed away by the sea,<br>
Europe is the less,<br>
As well as if a promontory were:<br>
As well as if a manor of thy friend's<br>
Or of thine own were.<br>

Any man's death diminishes me,<br>
Because I am involved in mankind.<br>
And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;<br>
It tolls for thee.<br>
