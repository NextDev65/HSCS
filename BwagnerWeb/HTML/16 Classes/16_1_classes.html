<h1>Java While Loop</h1>
<p>Java while loops can be classified into two categories: counter-controlled loops and sentinel-controlled loops.</p>
<h2>Counter-Controlled Loop</h2>
<p>A <span style="font-weight:bold">counter-controlled loop</span> is a loop that repeats a predetermined number of times. The condition of this type of loop is controlled by a counter variable. A counter is a variable that keeps count of the number of times a loop is executed. Look at the following example of a counter-controlled loop.</p>
<div class="code"><p>int counter = 1;

while(counter <= 10)
{
	System.out.println(counter);
	counter++;
}
</p></div>
<h2>Sentinel-Controlled Loop</h2>
<p>A <span style="font-weight:bold">sentinel-controlled loop</span> is a loop that executes an undetermined number of times. To stop the loop, a user enters a value, called a sentinel, which causes the loop's condition to become false. Look at the following example of a sentinel-controlled loop.</p>
<div class="code"><p>Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
String ans = "";

while(!ans.equals("stop"))
{
	ans = sc.nextLine();
}
</p></div>
